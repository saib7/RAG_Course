    "   - ✅ Quick database inspection and schema analysis\n",
    "   - ✅ Integration with LangChain SQL agents and tools\n",
    "   - ✅ Built-in safety features for query execution\n",
    "   - ❌ Limited control over document structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom SQL Processing**\n",
    "   - ✅ Production RAG systems requiring rich context\n",
    "   - ✅ Complex databases with multiple relationships\n",
    "   - ✅ Need for business-specific document formatting\n",
    "   - ✅ Advanced metadata requirements for filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQLDatabaseLoader**\n",

    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored comprehensive strategies for processing database data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Setup**: Created realistic SQLite databases with business relationships\n",
    "2. **SQLDatabase Utility**: Schema inspection and safe query execution\n",
    "3. **Custom SQL Processing**: Intelligent database-to-document conversion with rich context\n",
    "4. **SQLDatabaseLoader**: Direct query-to-document conversion with LangChain integration\n",
    "5. **Advanced Techniques**: Relationship extraction, batch processing, and security measures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose the right approach**: Simple loaders for basic extraction, custom processing for production\n",
    "- **Relationships matter**: Preserve foreign key relationships and business context\n",
    "- **Security is crucial**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection\n",
    "- **Performance considerations**: Implement batch processing for large databases\n",
    "- **Metadata is essential**: Rich metadata enables advanced filtering and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Implement database schema validation and inspection\n",
    "- [ ] Use parameterized queries for all dynamic SQL\n",
    "- [ ] Create relationship-aware documents that preserve business context\n",
    "- [ ] Include comprehensive metadata for filtering and search\n",
    "- [ ] Implement batch processing for large tables (>10,000 records)\n",
    "- [ ] Add connection pooling for high-volume applications\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor memory usage and query performance\n",
    "- [ ] Cache frequently accessed query results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Try with your own databases**: Apply these techniques to your real database schemas\n",
    "2. **Build a database processing pipeline**: Create automated workflows for different table types\n",
    "3. **Optimize for your queries**: Test different document structures with your specific questions\n",
    "4. **Scale for production**: Implement connection pooling, monitoring, and error recovery\n",
    "5. **Add incremental updates**: Process only changed data for efficiency\n",
