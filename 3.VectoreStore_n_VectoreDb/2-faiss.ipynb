    "**Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with generative AI models. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieves** relevant documents from a knowledge base using semantic search\n",
    "2. **Augments** the user query with retrieved context documents  \n",
    "3. **Generates** responses based on both the retrieved context and the model's knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, contextual responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- Access to up-to-date information not in training data\n",
    "- Reduced hallucinations through grounded responses  \n",
    "- Transparency through source attribution\n",
    "- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning large models"

    "https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, developed by Facebook AI Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Extremely fast similarity search** - Optimized algorithms for nearest neighbor search\n",
    "2. **Memory efficient** - Compressed vector representations\n",
    "3. **Supports GPU acceleration** - Leverages CUDA for massive speedups\n",
    "4. **Scalable** - Can handle millions to billions of vectors\n",
    "5. **Multiple index types** - Different algorithms for different use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- Creates specialized data structures (indexes) for fast vector similarity search\n",
    "- Uses approximate algorithms that trade slight accuracy for massive speed improvements\n",
    "- Returns most similar vectors based on distance metrics (L2, cosine, etc.)\n",
    "- Supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Document retrieval in RAG systems\n",
    "- Image similarity search  \n",
    "- Recommendation systems\n",
    "- Clustering and classification"
